# Control Flow (if_else)

Using an if expression allows you to execute certain code depending on conditions. Within the if statement provide a condition and then specify what you want to execute within the block of code. You can specify an else expression which is reached if the If condition is not met.

Here's a simple example of a contract using if and else statements for role based access control:

```rust
{{#include ../listings/ch00-introduction/if_else/src/access_control.cairo}}
```
